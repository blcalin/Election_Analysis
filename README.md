# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to utilize for loops and conditional statements, in order to analyze the voter turnout by county, percentage of votes and voter turnout. Using loops and conditional statements was necessary in order to quickly aggregate results, given the volume of data.

### Data
Data presented includes ballot ID, county and candidate name for the election at hand.

## Results and Analysis
 Through creation of Python script to read/write data, perform calculations on counts, and use loops/conditional statements to analyze our findings. Utilizing Python and CSV through our data set, we determined the following:
 -369,711 votes were cast in the election
-The three candidates for office included:
  -Charles Casper Stockham
  -Diana DeGette
  -Raymon Anthony Doane
 -Denver had the largest county turnout, with 82.8% (306,055 votes), followed by the below counties:
  -Jefferson County had 10.5% of the vote at 38,855 votes
  -Arapahoe County had 6.7% of the vote at 24,801 votes
 -Results included the following:
  -Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote at 85,213 votes
  -Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote at 272,892 votes
  -Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote at 11,606 votes
 -Diana DeGette was the overall election winner

## Summary
### To the Election Commission

Overall, the use of this script can be very helpful for future elections. The ability to analyze voter turnout and percentage of votes can help specify where campaining needs to be done in the future to increase the number of voters. By analyzing this information, we can efficiently and effectively sort through large quantities of data, which saves time and resources, potentially lowering overall campaign/election costs.

By incorporating repeat voters and broadening the number of counties analyzed in the script as opposed to a select few, the election commission may be able to more succinctly identify where in the state of Colorado they need to focus on for future elections.
